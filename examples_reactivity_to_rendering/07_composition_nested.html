  > Alternatively, the easiest way to solve this issue,

  > Since the reactive scope is more or less a stack it is only the

  NOTE: this solves the problem of #05, but ...

  > This does have one gotcha. 
  > The observer pattern as used by these reactive libraries has the
  > potential to produce memory leaks. 
  > Computations that subscribe to signals that out live them are never 
  > released as long as the signal is still in use. 
  > Whenever the signal updates these computations will execute again 
  > even if not referenced anywhere.

  NOTE: to demonstrate this, show and hide the greeting. 
  The effect will still run even if the element ist not referenced anymore.
